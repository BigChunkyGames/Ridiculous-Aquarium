About me:

Overcome with nostalgia for Insane Aquarium, I became determined to remake the game with modern graphics and more lasers. I started this project in August 2019 working primarily during class on my laptop. Now, less than a year later, I am ready to release the Beta. There is still much to add, so stay tuned!
